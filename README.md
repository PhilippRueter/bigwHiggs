# bigwHiggs

Here we will try to bring together notes from our time on the Isle. 
This is the first time I have tried to coordinate an activity like this, so please bear with. 

## Aim
1. To produce a single document that presents a coherent overview of Higgs bundles: 
chapters will directly reflect the titles of each talk,
which collectively present a coherent narrative on Higgs bundles. 

2. To complete this soonish.

## The problem
The quality, correctness, and completeness of the notes on each talk varies greatly, but all are sub-optimal. 
This is due to time constraints, and my mathematical ignorances, poor texing, and inability to read the far righthand board.
There are many gaps I cannot fill in, and errors I cannot correct. 
You know your stuff and this is where I need your help.

## What you can do 
1. Let me know if this IS or IS NOT something you are interested in engaging with. 
2. Edit the stub that relates your talk to improve, correct, and complete it.

Please do what is best for you. 
If you think a complete rewrite is in order, then do so. 
If you can't stomach more than pointing out references addressing the fallacies and omissions, then do so.
If you do not like drawing commutative diagrammes or tables either, then skip. 
And so on.  

# Finer points 

## Tex
Talks are entitled chronologically, bar the initial talk entitled overview.tex. 
The preamble is in a standalone file called preamble.tex.
I assume you are all familiar with tex - there is only one maths document formatting programme. 

The main problem with collaborative work on tex documents is that they are package dependent, 
and we'll run into compiling issues on our different machines and varying versions of software.  

## Git 
I have no idea through what design one should organise this undertaking in order to minimise headaches.
Git may not have been a great choice, but here we are.

Git is a Version Control System. 
If you are not familiar with it, fear not. 
It is not necessary for this project.
Plenty of information is online if you do wish to know more. 

For those who know git please clone, branch (with your name), edit and push.
For those who know NO git please copy, edit and paste into an email to me (dw580@bath.ac.uk). 

## Editing 
You may wish to compile the document as you edit. 
To do this you will need a copy of the preamble.tex in the same directory (folder) 
as the document you want to compile. 
If you need any additional packages, add them to the preamble and push or send that back too. 

## Standards 
####** 1 sentence, 1 line. ** 

This makes it much much easier to track changes. 
It makes no difference in the compiled pdf at the end. 

As To keep notation consistent please adopt the following.

1. Higgs fields (and nothing but) are denoted \varphi except in exceptional circumstances. 
2. And so on.
